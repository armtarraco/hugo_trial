In Ruby module Forwardable, you can find the following line

	#{accessor}.__send__(:#{method}, *args, &block)

This lets delegate some method to another class simplifying the code. For example,

Instead of writing

	class Owner
	    def phone
	        '457364'
	    end
	end

    class Space
        def phone
            owner.phone
        end
        def owner
            @owner ||= Owner.new
        end
    end

is shorter and easier to read

    require 'forwardable'
    class Owner
        def phone
            '457364'
        end
    end
    class Space
        extend Forwardable
        delegate :phone => :owner
        def owner
            @owner ||= Owner.new
        end
    end

I want to explain why it uses \`\`\`__send__\`\`\` instead of \`\`\`send\`\`\`.

The send method can be override. Example:

    class Foo
        def __send__(\*args, &block)
            false
        end
        def bar
            true
        end
    end
    Foo.new.bar
    => true
    Foo.new.send(:bar)
    => false
    Foo.new.__send__(:bar)
    => true

To avoid conflicts, specially in gems or libraries when the context where it will be used is unknown, always use \`\`\`__send__\`\`\`.

Ruby warns when trying to redefine it:

	warning: redefining \`__send__' may cause serious problems
